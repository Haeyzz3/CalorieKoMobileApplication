/**
 * Data models for the CalorieKo application.
 *
 * This package contains all shared data classes used across the app.
 * Screen-specific models (e.g., ScanStatus, PairingStatus) remain
 * co-located with their respective screen files.
 *
 * TODO: Migrate data classes from screen files here as the app grows:
 *   - UserData, Badge          → from ProfileScreen.kt
 *   - ActivityLogEntry         → from DashboardScreen.kt
 *   - Recipe, PlannedMeal      → from PantryScreen.kt
 *   - DailyCalorie, etc.       → from ProgressScreen.kt
 *   - ActivityItem             → from LogWorkoutScreen.kt
 *   - HealthGoal               → from GoalSelectionScreen.kt
